     <h2>Operation Theatre Management</h2>
   <p>

Surgeries are long and tedious and a hospital must know the schedule of surgeries, to avoid overbooking and ensure availability of the required surgeons, other doctors and operation theatre staff. A hospital would be able to send operation schedules, test results, and other details to patients/next of kin, while also sending reminders to the presiding surgeon and other staff required for a procedure.</p>

     <h2>Supply Management</h2>
   <p>
With efficient hospital management systems (HMS), hospital management can track and manage supplies more efficiently and set up better purchasing contracts with suppliers. The system provides you with full transparency of inventory from the time it was ordered to when it was brought in to when it was used on patients. This, you can better capture demand, purchase, and consumption activity, allowing you to make continuous improvements to your healthcare supply chain.</p>

     <h2>Patient Management</h2>
   <p>
With faster, secure, and easy data retrieval, a hospital/healthcare facility would be able to provide better and efficient care to the patients. With every department interconnected and integrated into the HMS, the quality of patient care can be enhanced, leading to greater customer satisfaction and lowered turnovers. Today there is severe competition even in the realm of healthcare, and patients and their kin prefer to visit a facility that is efficient, cost-effective, and secure.</p>
